Domofera MOOC
===========================
The aim of this writting is to have a log and a history about what I do, step by step.

Introduction
--------
**Domofera MOOC** is an Urban agriculture MOOC (Masive Online Open Course) which purpose is to teach people of any level of agriculture knowledge how to grew an allotment.

It's made in Google Course Builder, and I'll write about its development.

Install & deploy
-----
Google AppEngine is used to host for free Google Course Builder. So the first step is to sign in (or sign up if you don't have AppEngine account) and create an App.

Next, you must download [Google Course Builder, Python 2.X and AppEngine].

Once you've done it, proceed to **deployment**. Open the AppEngine, drag and drop the folder of your Course Builder version, that's all.

![Drag app](https://github.com/Domofera/Domofera_MOOC/blob/master/src/docu/img/drag_app.jpg "Drag app")

Now you only have to click the "Play" button. Now it's running in your machine. Click the "Browse" button and a browser will open to show your app.
